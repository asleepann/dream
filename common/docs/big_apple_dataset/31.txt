The Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade.Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business.For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions.Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them.These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products.
