The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion.The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”).On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision.On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice.The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries.
