Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects.Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings.Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.
