Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
