For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered.For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services.The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers.The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product.
