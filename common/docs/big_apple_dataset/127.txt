Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries.Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves.Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination or the refinement of an estimate.
