The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve.Based on investment positions as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively.
