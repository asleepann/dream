The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future.For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries.The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Companyâ€™s operations and distracting to management.
